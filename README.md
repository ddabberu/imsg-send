# imsg-send
Ever wondered how to broadcast messages to some or all of your contacts with your imessage application, without creating groups?
Its more common than you might think. I have scanned the internet and put together a script using apple script and a good old shell.

# How to
- import contatcs into spread sheet, and get the phone numbers into a txt file one per each line.
- pass the text file and the message as arguments to run.sh.
- execute the shell script.


# TBD 
-- automation of extracting contacts numbers into txt file using lables
